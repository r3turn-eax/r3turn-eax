Hi,

I am an aspiring malware analyst and malware emulation and detection engineer. I have experience crafting detection rules with SIEMs, threat hunting, and incident response.
I will be posting:
1) Malware Analysis reports
2) Code to emulate malware to test detection mechanisms including AV, EDR, etc. This could be PEs, Maldocs, LOLbins, etc. This will be mapped to MITRE ATT&CK for various advanced malware functions such as evasion, priv esc, process injection, lateral movement, etc.
